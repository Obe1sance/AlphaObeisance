# NOOB-NOTE: System-Wide Variables in Hyprland
# The Variables section helps you store important system settings and paths in one central
# location. By defining variables here, you can quickly reference and adjust these settings
# across your configuration, making it easier to manage your environment. For example,
# you might define the path to your terminal or editor so you can use that variable
# throughout your config file. This saves you from needing to type the full path everywhere.

# Tip: If you need to change the location of an application or directory, update it in the
# variables section and the change will automatically apply throughout your config.

# For more info on variables and their use, visit: https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Variables/
