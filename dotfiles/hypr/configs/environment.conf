# NOOB Note: Environment
# Environment variables optimize system behavior for performance, appearance, and compatibility.
# They’re useful for tweaking the environment for Wayland, Electron apps, GTK/Qt themes, etc.
# Most users won't need to modify these unless specifically advised.

# Environment Variables (Hyprland Setup)
env = XDG_SESSION_TYPE=wayland             # Use Wayland as display server
env = ELECTRON_OZONE_PLATFORM_HINT=auto    # Enable auto-hinting for Electron apps on Wayland

# NVIDIA GPU Configuration (For OpenGL & Video Acceleration)
# Enable hardware acceleration for video decoding and OpenGL rendering on NVIDIA GPUs
env = LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME=nvidia             # Enable VA-API for NVIDIA hardware video acceleration
env = __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia     # Use NVIDIA’s GLX for OpenGL
env = GBM_BACKEND=nvidia-drm               # Enable NVIDIA DRM backend for direct rendering
env = renderer=nvidia                      # Explicitly use NVIDIA renderer
env = NVD_BACKEND,direct

# OpenGL Optimization for NVIDIA (Optional)
# Enable threaded optimizations in OpenGL for better performance
env = __GL_THREADED_OPTIMIZATIONS=1        # Enable OpenGL threaded optimizations for better GPU utilization

# Cursor Settings (Using custom theme and size)
env = XCURSOR_SIZE=24                      # Set global cursor size (24px)
env = cursor=Colloid-cursors               # Custom cursor theme for consistency

# GTK and Application Theme Settings (For consistency and better aesthetics)
env = GTK_THEME=Kripton                    # Set GTK theme to Kripton
env = GTK_ICON_THEME=kora-grey             # Set GTK icon theme to Kora-Grey
env = GDK_BACKEND=wayland                  # Force GTK-based apps to use Wayland backend

# Qt Platform Settings (For Wayland and custom window decorations)

env = QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR=1        # Enable automatic scaling for Qt apps

# Optional: Software Rendering (for Wayland compositors)
env = WLR_RENDERER_ALLOW_SOFTWARE=0        # Disable software rendering for Wayland; use hardware acceleration
# If you experience performance issues, enable it to force software rendering:
# env = WLR_RENDERER_ALLOW_SOFTWARE=1      # Enable software rendering for specific compatibility issues

# Disabling unnecessary effects for performance (Optional)
# Reduce render load and improve performance by disabling animations
env = HYPRLAND_DISABLE_ANIMATIONS=false     # Disable window animations for improved performance in Hyprland

# Cursor Behavior (Ensure no hardware cursor is used)
cursor {
