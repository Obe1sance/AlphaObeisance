# NOOB-NOTE: Input Device Configuration in Hyprland
# This section allows you to customize your keyboard, mouse, and touchpad settings.
# You can adjust the layout, sensitivity, and behavior of your input devices to suit
# your personal preferences. It also supports advanced configurations, such as
# per-device settings and laptop-specific gestures.

# Tip: Most users can stick with the default settings here, but if you have specific input
# preferences (e.g., for a gaming mouse or touchpad gestures), this section gives you
# the flexibility to customize your devices.

# This allows per-device sensitivity adjustments for individual input devices

# Laptop functionality settings for specific actions, such as gestures
