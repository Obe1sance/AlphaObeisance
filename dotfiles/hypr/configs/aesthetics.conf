# NOOB-NOTE: Aesthetic Settings in Hyprland
# This section defines how your windows look and behave on the screen. It covers window
# layouts, spacing, borders, animations, and more, allowing you to customize your desktop
# experience for both appearance and functionality.

# Tip: Play around with the gaps, borders, and layout to make your desktop look and work
# the way you want. Enable animations for smoother window transitions!

workspace = IMGEN, floating:0, rounding:true, decorate:true, gapsin:5, gapsout:5

# Customization Tips:
# - You can apply settings like rounding, decoration, or gaps to individual workspaces.
#   Example: workspace = 1, monitor:DP-2, rounding:true, gapsin:5, gapsout:15
#   This would give workspace 1 on DP-2 a rounded appearance with inner and outer window gaps.
