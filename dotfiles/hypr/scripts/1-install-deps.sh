#!/bin/bash

# This script automates the installation of a set of predefined software packages on an Arch-based Linux system.
# The script is organized into categories based on the type of functionality:
#
# - Music control packages (e.g., playerctl, mpc)
# - System utilities (e.g., upower, networkmanager)
# - Wallpaper setting tools (e.g., feh)
# - Performance monitoring tools (e.g., btop, fastfetch)
# - File management utilities (e.g., ranger)
# - Application launchers (e.g., rofi)
#
# Additionally, the script ensures that the AUR helper `yay` is installed, which is required to install packages
# from the Arch User Repository (AUR). It also installs specific AUR packages such as hypridle, hyprlock, hyprpaper,
# and waypaper for managing your desktop environment.
#
# The script checks if each package is already installed and installs any missing packages using `pacman`
# or `yay` (for AUR packages) without requiring user interaction.
#
# To use this script, simply run it in a terminal on an Arch-based system with `sudo` privileges.
#
# Note: This script assumes you have a working internet connection and that your package manager is correctly configured.
