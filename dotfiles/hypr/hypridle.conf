# NOOB-NOTE: Hypridle is a tool for managing idle time in Hyprland.
# It locks your screen after a period of inactivity and sends notifications when you resume activity.

# Key sections:
# - `general`: Defines settings for the lock command to prevent multiple lock instances.
# - `listener`: Sets the timeout (in seconds) before the screen locks and the commands to run when idle time is detected or activity resumes.

# Example actions:
# - `lock_cmd`: Defines the command to lock the screen (uses hyprlock).
# - `timeout`: Sets how long (in seconds) of inactivity before locking.
# - `on-resume`: Sends a "Welcome back" notification when activity is detected after timeout.
# - `on-timeout`: Locks the screen when idle time exceeds the timeout.

# Tip: Adjust the timeout and notifications based on your preferences.
